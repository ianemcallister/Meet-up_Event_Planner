<p>This is an assignment as part of the Senior Web Developer Nano Degree on Udacity.<p>

<p><strong>Requirnments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Front End</strong></p>

<p>I'll be using AngularJS to write a single page application.</p>

<p><strong>Back End</strong></p>

<p>Instead of writing a backend I'm going to utilize Firebase to store objects on the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>Development Environment</strong></p>

<p>I like the responsive feedback that gulp and browser-sync provide.  I'll be using eslint for linting.  I'll be writing some sass for the styles and be using sourcemaps and uglify to prepare the application for production.</p>

<p>More updates to come later.</p>
