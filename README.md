# Project 1: Meet-Up Event Planner
______________________________________________

This is my first project as part of the Senior Web Developer Nano Degree through Udacity.

To test on mobile I've uploaded this project to my temporary web server, the project can be found here: http://79.170.44.81/ianemcallister.com/eventPlanner/index.html#/

## Features

* Account creation, event creation and event display
* All forms are fully functional and react to touches naturally on mobile or desktop
* The app is accessible (all forms are understandable while using a screen reader)
* The user experience is enhanced with prompts (labels, placeholders, error messages, etc) that appear in logical order and are phrased in friendly, human language
* The inputs are kept to minimum to keep the end user happy and they are instantly validated (not later than on blur) keeping the user informed and avoiding submitting invalid information
* Forms can be prefilled with existing user data
* All input have appropriate types and are labeled (even if only for screen readers)
* The autofocus is applied to the first field above-the-fold
* The required fields are kept to minimum
